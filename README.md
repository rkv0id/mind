# Mind - (WIP)
Mind - *tags for the sane*. A NIMble and efficient tag-based system for file and content management.

With a focus on simplicity, **Mind** allows users to effortlessley exploit the tagging system to create multiple layouts and structures (think quick semantic lookups, or even KANBAN for your terminal). All due to tags and a powerful boolean-based lookup DSL.

### TODOs

- [ ] Tags support
- [ ] Files sym and hard links
- [ ] Synchronise hard and sym links
- [ ] Backups (compression and auto-backups)
- [ ] Some CLI visual work
- [ ] Lookup DSL
