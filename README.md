# Mind - (WIP)
Mind - *tags for the sane*. A NIMble and efficient tag-based system for file and content management.

With a focus on simplicity, **Mind** allows users to effortlessley exploit the tagging system to create multiple layouts and structures (think quick semantic lookups, or even KANBAN for your terminal). All due to tags and a powerful boolean-based lookup DSL.
