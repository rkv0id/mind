# Mind - (WIP)
Mind - *tags for the sane*. A NIMble and efficient tag-based system for file and content management. It also provides memos and todo tasks utilities.

With a focus on simplicity, **Mind** allows users to effortlessley exploit the tagging system to create multiple layouts and structures (think memos in a file-tree structure, or even KANBAN for your terminal). All due to tags and a powerful boolean-based lookup DSL.

### TODOs

- [ ] Memos support
- [ ] Tasks support
- [ ] Tags support
- [ ] Basic CLI tooling & filtering
- [ ] Some visual work
- [ ] Backup compression and auto-backups
- [ ] Lookup DSL
